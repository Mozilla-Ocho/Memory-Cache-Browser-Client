# Memory Cache Browser Client

A browser client for [Memory Cache](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/Memory-Cache).

## Overview

Memory Cache Browser Client is a frontend component of Memory Cache:

- It sends commands and displays information from [Memory Cache Hub](https://github.com/johnshaughnessy/Memory-Cache-Hub/).
- It allows users to view and manage project artifacts, llamafiles, and settings.
- It allows users to query LLMs using Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- It allows users to view and manage prompt templates and long-running background tasks.

## Installation

Memory Cache Browser Client is included in each release of Memory Cache Hub, so you do not need to install it separately.

To install Memory Cache Hub, follow the instructions in the [Memory Cache Hub README](https://github.com/johnshaughnessy/Memory-Cache-Hub/README.md#Installation).

A Firefox browser extension for Memory Cache that extends its functionality is also available. More information can be found in the main [Memory Cache repository](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/Memory-Cache).
