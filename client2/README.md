Memory Cache Browser Client is built with `node v18.18.2` and `npm v10.4.0`. Other versions of `node` and `npm` may work, but they are not officially supported.

The project started as a `create-react-app` project with `typescript` enabled. We `eject`ed to have more control over the configuration.

The `src/api/` directory contains the code for communicating with the Memory Cache Hub apis. It is autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification provided by the Memory Cache Hub. 

To regenerate the code:

``` sh
# Delete the src/api/ directory
rm -r src/api/

# Delete the old OpenAPI specification
rm openapi.json

# Download the latest OpenAPI specification from the Memory Cache Hub
wget http://localhost:4444/openapi.json

# Regenerate the code
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.json -g typescript-fetch -o src/api
```

The project is configured to use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, which rely on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. See the documentation in those projects for more information.
