# Client 3

Client 2 uses shadcn/ui + tailwindcss, npm and webpack. This is fine. But let's try something different.

Client 3 uses tailwindcss, yarn, and parcel.

I did:

``` sh
sudo corepack enable
yarn init -2
yarn set version stable
yarn install
```

Then I set up parcel and tailwindcss.


The `src/api/` directory contains the code for communicating with the Memory Cache Hub apis. It is autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification provided by the Memory Cache Hub. 

To regenerate the code:

``` sh
# Delete the src/api/ directory
rm -r src/api/

# Delete the old OpenAPI specification
rm openapi.json

# Download the latest OpenAPI specification from the Memory Cache Hub
wget http://localhost:4444/openapi.json

# Regenerate the code
yarn dlx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.json -g typescript-fetch -o src/api
```
